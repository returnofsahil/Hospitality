In the repository I have analyzed the data (csv ,cleaned it) and  derived insigths from it. The information about the case study in available in the ppt or the tableau dashboard or the Jupiter notebook

Case Statement
You work for a European boutique hotel/home accommodation company that wants to expand to New York City, its first North American operation.
The company wants to establish a network of home accommodation in New York City.
Your company assumes that business travelers will want the opportunity to cook for themselves rather than spend months eating restaurant food.
Additionally, you expect your corporate customers to prefer home accommodations as a more cost-effective alternative to typical hotels.
In summary, your corporate customers and the business travelers who work for them are looking for good value â€“
reasonable price and proximity to commercial areas of New York City. You believe home accommodation may be a money-making opportunity for your company.
